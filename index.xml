      <description>On one of my project it was a requirement to reduce the ElasticBeanstalk hosting costs to minimum for dotnet application. The app is a kind of dashboard with limited audience and nothing heavy inside. I decided to use Graviton2 instances (ARM processors on board) in order to acheave best speed/cost ratio.</description>

      <description>Software products can be much better if anybody start asking questions about who will use it. We need user researchers called Interaction Designers (IxD) that will prove we are creating something that can be used by people. Where to find them? Business analysts are best people to start looking.</description>

      <title>3 steps to create integration tests for your ASP.NET MVC 5 application</title>
      <link>https://byalexblog.net/article/3-steps-integration-testing-aspnet-mvc/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://byalexblog.net/images/3-steps-integration-testing-aspnet-mvc/integration-testing-mock-component.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
When you develop an ASP.NET MVC application you should test it anyway. You can cover different parts of your application logic with unit tests or you can create tests that look like user interaction scenarios. These tests have several advantages over unit tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These tests are independent of implementation and you can&amp;rsquo;t break your test by refactoring (the only scenario when you should modify your test is functional requirement change).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These tests are good documentation for your application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These tests can give you idea about that your users need and how will they supposed to use concrete feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Merge SQL databases</title>
      <link>https://byalexblog.net/article/merge-sql-databases/</link>

      <description>Imagine you have 2 databases with identical schema. These databases were working for different application instances for some time. And now you need to merge them together for some reason. You can use different tools to achieve this goal. For example &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devart.com/ru/dbforge/sql/datacompare/&#34;&gt;dbForge Data Compare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-data-compare/&#34;&gt;SQL Data Compare&lt;/a&gt;. But these tools cost money and if you don&amp;rsquo;t merge databases every day this is probably not an option for you. Also these tools does not know full specific of your database structure including unique indexes, check constraints and triggers. Another big deal is identity columns that are using as primary keys. For two databases these keys can be same but represent different entities.  In my practice I face database merge task second time and here is how I handle it.</description>

      <description>You never know what will come from remote system. Even if you keep everything under control, there always can be something unexpected. In microservice architecture each component must be ready for everything.</description>

      <title>Custom domain name for Azure VM</title>

      <guid>https://byalexblog.net/article/custom-domain-name-for-azure-vm/</guid>
      <description>If you are running VM on Azure you know that your default domain name looks like this: &lt;code&gt;yourservicename.cloudapp.net&lt;/code&gt;. Also public IP address is not static that means you can&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;lsquo;A&amp;rsquo; DNS record on it.</description>
