I have some Python Azure Functions and recently I decided to review and improve the logging mechanism for them (Azure Application Insights integration). What I wanted to acheave is to have visual spans for individual function calls that can be nested and give the better idea of the function call behavior.

<img src=/images/azure-sql-database-export-to-local/terminal.png alt> Exporting an Azure SQL Server database locally is a common task for developers and administrators who need to create backups, test changes, or migrate databases to other environments. If your SQL Server instance is configured with Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) authentication, you might face an issue connecting to the database with username and password from the command line tool like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlpackage/sqlpackage?view=sql-server-ver16" target=_blank rel=noopener>SqlPackage</a>.
In this guide, I’ll walk you through the process of exporting an Azure SQL Server database to your local windows machine using Powershell, SqlPackage tool and Azure SQL Server with Entra ID authentication.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/article/azure-sql-database-export-to-local/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/azure-resource-group/>Is Azure Resource Group just a Logical Container?</a></h1><time datetime=2024-07-11T13:19:52Z class=post-date>Thu, Jul 11, 2024</time>

<img src=/images/i-like-to-write-comments-now/logo.jpeg alt> In the realm of software development, the utility of comments in code has long been a subject of debate. Traditionally, many have held the belief that high-quality code should speak for itself, rendering comments unnecessary. This viewpoint advocates for self-explanatory code through well-named variables, functions, and classes, and a logical assembly of the code structure. However, the advent of AI-assistants like GitHub Copilot is challenging this notion, ushering in a new perspective on the role of comments in coding. In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll explore how AI is reshaping our approach to commenting, transforming it from a tedious task to an integral part of the coding process.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/article/rethinking-code-comments-in-the-ai-era/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/azure-apimanagement-to-azure-cosmosdb/>Azure API Management to Azure Cosmosdb</a></h1><time datetime=2023-11-07T20:12:52Z class=post-date>Tue, Nov 7, 2023</time>

Running a React frontend web application on an Azure Storage account is a great way to host your app with a low cost and high scalability.

In my <a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/azure-apimanagement-to-azure-storage-account/ title="Azure API Management to Azure Storage Account" target=_blank rel=noopener>previous post</a> I showed how to use <a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management title="Azure API Management" target=_blank rel=noopener>Azure API Management</a> to expose an <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview title="Azure Storage Account" target=_blank rel=noopener>Azure Storage Account</a>. In this post I will show how to use Azure API Management to expose an <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/service-bus-messaging-overview title="Azure Service Bus" target=_blank rel=noopener>Azure Service Bus</a>.
This combination is useful when you have a fire and forget HTTP endpoint and you expect irregular traffic. For example, you are designing a mobile application crash reporting system. You want to send the crash report to the server and forget about it. You don&rsquo;t want to wait for the response. You don&rsquo;t want to block the user interface. You don&rsquo;t want to retry if the server is not available. It might happen that a new mobile app version has a significant bug and you get a lot of crash reports. In this case, it is reasonable to use Azure Service Bus to queue the crash reports for peak times and process them later.
As in my <a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/azure-apimanagement-to-azure-storage-account/ title="Azure API Management to Azure Storage Account" target=_blank rel=noopener>previous post</a>, I will use a scenario with two brands (Adidas and Nike) to show you the flexibility of the combination Azure API Management plus Azure Service Bus. I will also define everything in <a href=https://www.terraform.io/ title=Terraform target=_blank rel=noopener>Terraform</a> so the solution deployment is fully automated.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/article/azure-apimanagement-to-azure-service-bus/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/azure-apimanagement-to-azure-storage-account/>Azure API Management to Azure Storage Account</a></h1><time datetime=2023-07-06T08:32:23Z class=post-date>Thu, Jul 6, 2023</time>
<img src=/images/azure-apimanagement-to-azure-storage-account/apim_to_blob.jpg alt> There can be the case when you need to upload a file or metadata to <a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview target=_blank rel=noopener>Azure Storage Account</a> from an application which is outside of your cloud infrastructure. You should not expose your storage account to the internet for that purpose. There are many reasons for that: securuty, flexibility, monitoring etc. The natural solution to acheave the goal is to use something in between of your Azure Storage Account and the public internet. Some kind of HTTP proxy that will manage user authentication, do some simple validations and then pass the request to Storage Account to save the request body data as a blob. <a href=https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management target=_blank rel=noopener>Azure API Management</a> is a perfect candidate for that role. It is a fully managed service that means you don&rsquo;t need to create any custom application. It is highly available and scalable. It has a lot of features that can be used for your needs.
In this article I will show how to configure Azure API Management to upload a file to Azure Storage Account.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/article/azure-apimanagement-to-azure-storage-account/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/azure-sql-schema-deployment/>Breaking Through Barriers: Simplifying CD with Automated Azure SQL Schema Changes!</a></h1><time datetime=2023-06-10T10:57:21Z class=post-date>Sat, Jun 10, 2023</time>
<img src=/images/azure-sql-schema-deployment/logo.jpg alt> Have you ever tried to deploy a Microsoft SQL database schema to Azure SQL using a linux-based CI/CD pipeline? If you did, you probably know that it is not a trivial task. The reason is that the <a href=https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild target=_blank rel=noopener>Microsoft.Data.Tools.Msbuild</a> package is not available for linux. The package contains MSBuild targets and properties that are used to build and deploy database projects. The package is a part of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssdt/download-sql-server-data-tools-ssdt?view=sql-server-ver15" target=_blank rel=noopener>SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)</a> and it is not available for linux. So if you want to deploy a database schema to Azure SQL using a linux-based CI/CD pipeline you need to use a different approach. In this article we will see how to deploy a Microsoft SQL database schema to Azure SQL using <strong>any</strong> linux-based CI/CD pipeline (Gitlab, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc).<div class=read-more-link><a href=/article/azure-sql-schema-deployment/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/azure-function-serverless-deployment-python/>Azure Function Serverless Deployment Python</a></h1><time datetime=2023-05-26T12:03:58Z class=post-date>Fri, May 26, 2023</time>

When you develop an ASP.NET MVC application you should test it anyway. You can cover different parts of your application logic with unit tests or you can create tests that look like user interaction scenarios. These tests have several advantages over unit tests:</p><ul><li>These tests are independent of implementation and you can&rsquo;t break your test by refactoring (the only scenario when you should modify your test is functional requirement change).</li><li>These tests are good documentation for your application.</li><li>These tests can give you idea about that your users need and how will they supposed to use concrete feature.</li></ul><div class=read-more-link><a href=/article/3-steps-integration-testing-aspnet-mvc/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/merge-sql-databases/>Merge SQL databases</a></h1><time datetime=2016-05-27T11:55:25+0300 class=post-date>Fri, May 27, 2016</time>
Imagine you have 2 databases with identical schema. These databases were working for different application instances for some time. And now you need to merge them together for some reason. You can use different tools to achieve this goal. For example <a href=https://www.devart.com/ru/dbforge/sql/datacompare/ target=_blank rel=noopener>dbForge Data Compare</a> or <a href=http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-data-compare/ target=_blank rel=noopener>SQL Data Compare</a>. But these tools cost money and if you don&rsquo;t merge databases every day this is probably not an option for you. Also these tools does not know full specific of your database structure including unique indexes, check constraints and triggers. Another big deal is identity columns that are using as primary keys. For two databases these keys can be same but represent different entities.  In my practice I face database merge task second time and here is how I handle it.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/article/merge-sql-databases/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/rabbitmq-poisoned-messages-handeling/>RabbitMQ poisoned messages handling</a></h1><time datetime=2016-02-09T22:59:03+0300 class=post-date>Tue, Feb 9, 2016</time>
