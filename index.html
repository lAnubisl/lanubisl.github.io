Consumption plan is the cheapest way to run your Azure Function. However, it has some limitations. For example, you can not use Web Deploy, Docker Container, Source Control, FTP, Cloud sync or Local Git. You can use External package URL or Zip deploy instead. In this article I will show you how to deploy Dotnet Isolated Azure Function App to Linux Consumption Azure Function resource using Zip Deployment.</article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/react-azure-storage/>Host React frontend app on Azure Storage Account</a></h1><time datetime=2023-01-10T22:03:40Z class=post-date>Tue, Jan 10, 2023</time>

Dapper is a MicroORM that allows you to control SQL queries you are executing and removes the pain of mapping the dataset results back to your domain model. The thing is that when you specify SQL queries you have to make sure they are valid against the current Database schema. One solution is to use Stored Procedures&mldr; other one is this&mldr;</article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/aws-certificatemanager-tls-cert-import/>AWS Certificate Manager TLS Certificate import</a></h1><time datetime=2022-08-23T11:18:30+0200 class=post-date>Tue, Aug 23, 2022</time>

On one of my project it was a requirement to reduce the ElasticBeanstalk hosting costs to minimum for dotnet application. The app is a kind of dashboard with limited audience and nothing heavy inside. I decided to use Graviton2 instances (ARM processors on board) in order to acheave best speed/cost ratio.</article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/linux-nas-drive-format-command/>My current command to format hard drive for linux NAS</a></h1><time datetime=2021-08-03T21:22:05+0300 class=post-date>Tue, Aug 3, 2021</time>

Software products can be much better if anybody start asking questions about who will use it. We need user researchers called Interaction Designers (IxD) that will prove we are creating something that can be used by people. Where to find them?

When you develop an ASP.NET MVC application you should test it anyway. You can cover different parts of your application logic with unit tests or you can create tests that look like user interaction scenarios. These tests have several advantages over unit tests:</p><ul><li>These tests are independent of implementation and you can&rsquo;t break your test by refactoring (the only scenario when you should modify your test is functional requirement change).</li><li>These tests are good documentation for your application.</li><li>These tests can give you idea about that your users need and how will they supposed to use concrete feature.</li></ul></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/merge-sql-databases/>Merge SQL databases</a></h1><time datetime=2016-05-27T11:55:25+0300 class=post-date>Fri, May 27, 2016</time>
Imagine you have 2 databases with identical schema. These databases were working for different application instances for some time. And now you need to merge them together for some reason. You can use different tools to achieve this goal. For example <a href=https://www.devart.com/ru/dbforge/sql/datacompare/>dbForge Data Compare</a> or <a href=http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-data-compare/>SQL Data Compare</a>. But these tools cost money and if you don&rsquo;t merge databases every day this is probably not an option for you. Also these tools does not know full specific of your database structure including unique indexes, check constraints and triggers. Another big deal is identity columns that are using as primary keys. For two databases these keys can be same but represent different entities.  In my practice I face database merge task second time and here is how I handle it.</article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/rabbitmq-poisoned-messages-handeling/>RabbitMQ poisoned messages handling</a></h1><time datetime=2016-02-09T22:59:03+0300 class=post-date>Tue, Feb 9, 2016</time>

If you are running VM on Azure you know that your default domain name looks like this: <code>yourservicename.cloudapp.net</code>. Also public IP address is not static that means you can&rsquo;t use &lsquo;A&rsquo; DNS record on it.</article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://byalexblog.net/article/using-msbuild-to-deploy-composite-web-application/>Using MSBuild to deploy composite web application</a></h1><time datetime=2015-04-30T17:30:52+0300 class=post-date>Thu, Apr 30, 2015</time>
